Since you've hit the limits on Netlify, **GitHub Pages** is the best alternative. It is:
1.  **Free & Unlimited** for public projects.
2.  **Reliable** (Hosted by GitHub).
3.  **No Limits** on viewing/bandwidth for standard use.

## Step 1: Get the Code Ready
I have already prepared your code. It is all in your local folder:
`c:\Users\sam\.gemini\antigravity\playground\stellar-prominence`

## Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository
1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and Log In (or Sign Up).
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top right -> **New repository**.
3.  **Repository name**: `stellar-meeting-room` (or anything you like).
4.  **Public**: Make sure "Public" is selected.
5.  **Initialize**: Check "Add a README file".
6.  Click **Create repository**.

## Step 3: Upload Your Files
1.  In your new repository, click the **Add file** dropdown button -> **Upload files**.
2.  Open your local folder: `c:\Users\sam\.gemini\antigravity\playground\stellar-prominence`.
3.  **Select ALL files** (`index.html`, `admin.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, etc.) and drag them into the GitHub page box.
    *   *Note: Do not upload the `.gemini` folder if you see it.*
4.  Wait for them to upload.
5.  In "Commit changes" box, type "Initial deploy".
6.  Click **Commit changes**.

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1.  In your repository, click **Settings** (top tab).
2.  On the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
3.  Under **Build and deployment** -> **Source**, keep it as "Deploy from a branch".
4.  Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and folder `/ (root)`.
5.  Click **Save**.

## Step 5: You're Live!
1.  Wait about 30-60 seconds.
2.  Refresh the Pages settings page.
3.  You will see a banner: **"Your site is live at..."**
4.  Click that link. That is your new permanent, unlimited URL.
